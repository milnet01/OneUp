# ONEUP-0054 — Python engine — build plan

**Spec:** [docs/specs/ONEUP-0054-python-engine.md](../specs/ONEUP-0054-python-engine.md)
**Status:** in progress — stage 1.

## Scope of this file

The spec's §4.6 owns the stage order and why each stage makes the next one safe.
This file holds the build steps, and only for the stage under way.

**Later stages are absent by rule, not by omission.**
`docs/standards/documentation.md` §2: *"A plan: when the item starts, never
before. A plan written months early describes code that does not exist yet — it
is fiction, and it will be wrong."* Stage 5's steps cannot be written before
stage 4 lands. Each stage's steps are appended here when that stage starts, and
the Status line above says which one that is.

## Stage 1 — the `ONEUP_ENGINE_CMD` indirection

**Branch: `main`.** `docs/standards/workflow.md` §9 routes it there, and §1.2
grants it by name as the first of the freeze's named exceptions — *"One named,
behaviour-neutral test-harness change"*. §1.2 calls it behaviour-neutral and,
unlike the second exception, does not say a 1.4.x is owed.

**What it must not become.** §4.4: the override is a **scalar** environment
variable that the suite word-splits into its argv array, because `export` drops
a Bash array. The default is `bash update_system.sh`; `python3 -m oneup.engine`
is longer by a word. Settle the encoding differently in two readers and gate G2
ends up diffing v1 against v1 and passing.

### Steps

1. **Bring §4.4's encoding correction to `main` first.** `main`'s copy of the
   spec still reads *"an `ONEUP_ENGINE_CMD` array override"*; the correction
   that makes it a scalar landed on `v2` with the ONEUP-0127 re-gate and was
   never merged back. Stage 1 is built on `main`, so an implementer reading
   `main`'s contract builds the array the re-gate removed — and §4.4's own
   warning is that the wrong encoding leaves G2 diffing v1 against v1 and
   passing. Documentation lands on `main` normally
   (`docs/standards/workflow.md` §1.2).
   → **verify:** `main`'s §4.4 no longer contains the word *array* describing
   the override, and states the scalar-and-word-split rule.

2. Build the argv array **once**, at the top of `tests/run-tests.sh` beside the
   existing `ENGINE=` assignment, from `ONEUP_ENGINE_CMD` with `bash $ENGINE` as
   the default. One reader of the variable means the call sites cannot disagree
   with each other about the encoding.
   → **verify:** `bash -n tests/run-tests.sh` parses, and the array holds the
   default's words when the variable is unset.

3. Word-split without globbing. Unquoted expansion inside an array assignment
   globs as well as splits, so a value containing `*` would expand against the
   working directory.
   → **verify:** `ONEUP_ENGINE_CMD='python3 -m oneup.engine'` yields those
   words and no others, and a value containing `*` yields the literal `*`.

4. Point `run_engine` at the array in place of its `bash "$ENGINE"` invocation,
   leaving every environment override and the appended `--log=` untouched.
   → **verify:** `tests/run-tests.sh` green on `main` with the variable unset.

5. Apply the same array by hand at the broken-pipe scenario — the one that
   invokes the engine directly so it can close stdout on it, under the comment
   beginning *"Invoked directly rather than through run_engine"*.
   → **verify:** that scenario's checks all still pass, and the engine still
   reaches `@@DONE@@` after the reader closes.

6. **Prove the indirection is not inert.** This is the step that makes stage 1
   observable at all: setting a variable nothing reads leaves the suite green
   exactly as it was, so green alone is evidence of nothing.
   → **verify:** point `ONEUP_ENGINE_CMD` at a stub that exits non-zero, run the
   suite, and see it go red. Unset it and see it go green again. A suite that
   stays green against the stub means one of the two sites still hardcodes
   `bash`.

7. Leave the readers that treat `$ENGINE` as a **file** alone — the
   keep-alive `sed`, the privileged-call-site count and the shared-argv check.
   §4.4 assigns the first to stage 2 and the other two to stage 5.
   → **verify:** `git diff` on `main` touches `tests/run-tests.sh` and the spec
   and nothing else, and none of those readers appears in the diff.

8. Run the full push gate.
   → **verify:** `./local-CI.sh` green on `main`.

9. Commit on `main`, then merge `main` into `v2` (§1.2, §2).
   → **verify:** `./local-CI.sh` green on `v2` after the merge.

10. Confirm the merge left the `--hold` scenario ONEUP-0044 added to `v2` still
    launching v1 on purpose. §4.4 assigns it to stage 2, alongside the
    `runstate.py` work it exercises.
    → **verify:** that scenario still reads `bash "$ENGINE" --size=system
    --hold` on `v2`, and stage 2's row in §4.6 is what changes it.

### Not a call site

`v2`'s pre-push-hook scenario derives `REPO="$(dirname "$ENGINE")"`. It uses
`$ENGINE` to locate the repository root and neither invokes nor reads the
engine, so it is outside §4.4's table and stage 1 does not touch it. Recorded
here so a later reader does not count it as a site somebody missed.

## Definition of done

**Stage 1 is done** when `main`'s §4.4 states the scalar encoding,
`./local-CI.sh` is green on `main` with
`ONEUP_ENGINE_CMD` unset, red with it pointed at a failing stub, and green again
on `v2` after the merge. Nothing about `main`'s behaviour changes.

**The item is done** at stage 9, when G1–G6 are met. `docs/design/oneup-2.0.md`
§7 owns the gate; spec §4.6 says which stage earns each of them and that stage 9
is the commit they are measured against.
